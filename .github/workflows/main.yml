# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  prettier:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        # Make sure the actual branch is checked out when running on pull requests
        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}

    - name: Prettify code
      uses: creyD/prettier_action@v3.0
      with:
        # This part is also where you can pass other options, for example:
        prettier_options: --write **/*.{js,md}
